# Trophy station (Tornament-Platform)
As an ongoing project, Trophy Station is a tournament organization platform where anyone can simply build their tournaments and gather candidates in a one place. User can register as a tournament admin or player and will have different procedures to follow in order to create a tournament or participate for a tournament. Once the admin creates a tournament, he/she can copy the tournament link and share with candidates to participate in. Admin can limit the teams count that will restrict users from registering teams after exceed the limit and then the system generates a appropriate bracket for start the tournament. Only admin can change teams in the bracket and players can follow that bracket in order to perform their teamâ€™s skill on particular days.
