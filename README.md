# Trophy station (A Tournament Oraganization Platform)
As an ongoing project, Trophy Station is a tournament organization platform where anyone can simply build their tournaments and gather candidates in a one place. Users can register as a tournament admin or player and will have different procedures to follow in order to create a tournament or participate in a tournament. Once the admin creates a tournament, he/she can copy the tournament link and share it with candidates to participate in. Admin can limit the teams count that will restrict users from registering teams after exceeding the limit and then the system generates an appropriate bracket to start the tournament. Only the admin can change teams in the bracket and players can follow that bracket in order to perform their teamâ€™s skill on particular days.
